# Women's Work : a living lab
Wearable computers, sensors, and big data to measure women's paid and unpaid work in society.

Project Objective
------------
This project aims to implement a toolset and experimental methodologies for measuring precisely the daily activities of individual (volunteer) women. The project will design a "living lab" leveraging big-data originating from: 

- Wearable computers (watches, wearable chips, etc.)
- Big Data resulting from mobile phone usage,
- Interactions with 3rd party (financial transactions, etc.)

This is done in support of [Sustainable Development Goal 5](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/), which seeks to "Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work [..] and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate"

"Living labs" are often used in developed countries to understand social behavior towards new policies and products. This project attempts to develop a set of tools and methodologies which are also suitable for living labs in developing and least-developed countries.
